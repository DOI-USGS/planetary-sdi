## Licensing
Licensing is a complex topic. The LSDI working group are not copyright attorneys and the information provided herein is offered only as guidance for making data as accessible as possible. Data licensing can be mandated by the funders of the data creation. Those requirements always take precedence over the LSDI-suggested licenses.

 1. For all data producers and data providers governed by the NASA SMD [SPD-41a](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/science-information-policy/) guidance concerning SMD-funded data, the [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license (SPD-41a, III.C.vii, pg. 5) should be used. We are promoting this license to align with SPD-41a. 
 1. For data not governed by SPD-41a, we suggest open, permissive licenses with attribution ([CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)) or attribution and share-alike clauses ([CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)). Attribution is desirable as citations are one way that the community measures the impact of data and publications.
