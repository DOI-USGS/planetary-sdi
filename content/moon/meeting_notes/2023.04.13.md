## Notes
- 


## Action Items
- Today or tomorrow - clean email; add context if needed, and send around for comment.
- Jay - update the webpage with all our contact info.
- Jay - update website with changes from word doc roadmap.
- Future longer-term work: It might be good to link to specific, concrete examples of a COG or a GeoPackage from the Data Format Standards page, but I'm not sure what would be the best exemplars here. (Jay)

Next Agenda:
- Road Map (outstanding questions)
- Standards docs released
- Look at the road map and plan remainder of FY23

Future discussions:
- On the "Data Interoperability Standards" page, it lists the "Lunar Polar Gridded Data Record" as a thing that appears to be different from the LOLA gridded data, so I'm not sure what that is.  There is also some repetition on this page that I'm not sure how to untangle (the three bullet points are kind of repeated and "proxy products" is repeated in sentences before them to make me wonder if there's a cut'n'paste error here. 

## Next Meeting
May 11th @ 2PM MST.
