The Lunar Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) working group is a voluntary cooperation between members of the lunar exploration community to evaluate existing spatial data and data standards for the moon and assess spatial data storage, acquisition, discovery, and use needs of the Lunar community. The Lunar SDI working group is the decision-making body of the Lunar SDI. 

The Lunar SDI has been endorsed by the NASA directed Mapping and Planetary Spatial Infrastructure Team (MAPSIT). The overarching goal of the Lunar SDI is to allow individuals that are not spatial data experts to use spatial data to the greatest extent possible, with the lowest possible overhead (Laura et al., 2018). This working group addresses spatial data complexities by defining policies and standards regarding data interoperability, data contribution, and the long-term maintenance for the benefit of all user communities. See the Lunar SDI Strategy Document for additional information.

The purpose of this governance document is to describe the organization of the Lunar SDI working group and the agreed upon policies for group norms, SDI data and license standards, membership in this working group, the working group organization, and decision-making procedures.
