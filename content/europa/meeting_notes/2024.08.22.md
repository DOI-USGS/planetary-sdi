## Agenda
- Waiting on data for release.

## Notes
- Discussion on the single band mosaic that we have received.
  - The color data are not spatialized.
  - We can build a quiver plot comparing the mosaic to USGS data.
  - Ideally, we have a product that has been reviewed.
  - Discussion of funding related to supporting efforts to compare the USGS and Schenk products.
    - Potential to propose under the USGS work package.
  - Discussion about how having a single set of products with error metrics is quite important.
- Discussiong releasing the USGS processed Voyager observations.
  - Lots of great progress on this. 
  - Mike has the lvl1s with updated SPICE. There might be L2s.
- Discussion - [NIMS](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/europa-galileo-nims-hyperspectral-map-products-registered-archive#open):
  - Re-release these to a new base.
  - Maybe not timely because Europa is on the way and stuff will move. (And see the above discussion about multiple datums.)
  - These would be the first hyperspectral.
  - ~40 images or so
  - Maybe FY25 USGS work package to ARD these.
- 

## Action Items
- Data update - Voyager ARD release and/or Schenk ARD preliminary release.
-
